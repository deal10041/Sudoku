# Sudoku

## Problem

Most of us get bored sometimes. For puzzle enthousiasts this results in a craving for challenging puzzles. Thus they embark on a search for more puzzle apps. Most apps provide this challenge, but only for a short amount of time, by having just a finite amount of time. If there was a way to provide the user with randomly generated puzzles, this problem is solved. Until the user is bored by that app as well, of course.

## Solution

With this sudoku app the user doesn't have to be bored for a while.
